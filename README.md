# First Homework: HTML CSS Code Refactor
Assignment to practice code refactoring for HTML and CSS.

## Project Objective  
The objective of this project is to refactor the HTML and CSS code for a site. The client is a marketing company that is looking to optimize their site for search engines and to meet accessibility standards. 

## The Work

### 1. Accessibility: 
Alt attributes were added for all image elements. 

### 2. Semantic HTML 
An appropriate title was added for the site to make for better branding and search engine optimization. 

Div tags were replaced with the appropriate semantic HTML tags when applicable. CSS styling was also updated to match with the corresponding tags. This allows for an easier to read code for both humans and search engines. 

The CSS was reordered to follow a sequential order in combination with the HTML code. 

With the code refactoring complete, the client's site is better equipped for search engines and accessibility.
